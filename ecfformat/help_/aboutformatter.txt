ChessResultsReport validates source documents containing results of chess games.


Run 'python -m pip show chessreports' at a command line to display version and dependency (requires and required-by) information.

Version numbers for the packages listed under 'requires' are given in the setup.py file.

Run 'python -m pip check' at a command line to display discrepancies between required and installed versions of packages.

'python' may need to be replaced by <path to>python<version> depending on the system configuration: 'python3.8' for example.

ChessResultsReport uses features introduced at Python3.4.

Python3.4, or later versions when available, must be installed to run ChessResultsReport.

tkinter, part of Python, must be installed to run ChessResultsReport.  Sometimes this is installed separately.
