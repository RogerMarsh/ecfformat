Buttons

The buttons just below the menu bar emulate a tabbed notebook (for example like the preference editor in most browsers).  (This user interface was built before Tk8.5 became available making tabbed notebook a standard feature.)

The buttons at the bottom of a tab are the actions specific to the tab.  An action such as 'Close' appears on several tabs, but the thing being closed is different.


Popup menus

These appear by right-click when the pointer location makes a choice of actions relevant.

On the tabs controlled by the Documents menu right-click scrolls one of the other panes in the tab to a relevant position if one can be determined.

On the windows created by the Sources menu items right-click usually scrolls one of the other panes in the window to a relevant position if one can be determined, but may ask for confirmation of an action instead.


Tab navigation

This document describes the tabs in ChessResultsReport.

These are:

	Edit

shown when a document is open

and other tabs shown to do actions requested from these tabs.

A number of tabs become available as subsidiaries of these tabs.

The sections below assume that the appropriate tab is active.


Edit:

Alt + g		Generate a validation report of the document contents.
Alt + o		Show, or hide, the original document (before any editing).
Alt + c		Close the document
Alt + v		Save any edits made to the document.
Alt + p		Save the validation report to a file.

If the 'Show Original' action is used it is replaced by the 'Hide Original' action; and the 'Generate', 'Save validation report', and 'Update', actions are removed.  Use the 'Hide Original' action to reverse the effect, except the 'Update' action does not come back if it were present.
