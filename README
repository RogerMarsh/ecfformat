Description
===========

Prepare `ECF`_ submission files for results of chess games from events such as tournaments and leagues.

Most data is entered by typing, and the rest is entered by selecting from a limited range of values.


Installation Instructions
=========================

This package is not available on PyPI, or any other package index, but can be installed by typing

   python -m pip install --user --trusted-host solentware.co.uk --find-links http://solentware.co.uk/wheels.html ecfformat

at the command prompt.

See `Python`_ and `pip`_ documentation for alternatives and platform-specific points.

Then run 'python -m pip check' to identify other packages which need to be installed.


Run
===

The command to run this package is:

   python -m ecfformat.ecfformat

You may need to give the path and version of Python depending on your system's configuration:

   <path to python>/python<version> -m ecfformat.ecfformat

   For example

      C:\\Python34\\python -m ecfformat.ecfformat

         on Microsoft Windows or

      python3.4 -m ecfformat.ecfformat

         on Unix-like systems.

Or use the facilities of your desktop (Microsoft Windows, GNOME, KDE, ...) to set up a convenient way of starting results_report.


Notes
=====

The ecfformat package supports the preparation of ECF submission files for events to the `ECF`_.  Submission of these files is left to other software or the `web interface`_ provided by the ECF to do this.
